  <h1 class="post-title">What is Oblivious Algorithms</h1>
  <time datetime="2025-02-17T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">17 Feb 2025</time>
  <p>When one is using cloud services, simply encrypting the data is not enough. Patterns in data accessâ€”such as which files are read or written and how oftenâ€”can reveal sensitive information, even if the data itself is encrypted. This vulnerability is particularly concerning as more data is stored and processed in the cloud, where service providers or malicious attackers may monitor access patterns.</p>

<p>Oblivious Algorithms addresses the critical privacy gap mentioned above by ensuring that access patterns remain hidden, protecting users from potential information leaks. As a result, Oblivious Algorithms are essential for building secure systems that uphold privacy in sensitive applications like finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-access-pattern-leakage">Examples of Access Pattern Leakage</h2>
<h3 id="private-contact-discovery">Private Contact Discovery</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario: Messaging App with Private Contact Discovery</strong>
A secure messaging app (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp, or Telegram) allows users to discover which of their phone contacts also use the app.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database Structure: Each entry correponds to a registered userâ€™s phone number and account information.</li>
  <li>New User Matching Process: When a new user register, users can sync their contacts to check who is on the platform without revealing raw phone numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Leakage Due to Unprotected Access Patterns</strong>
The service provider, government agency, or hacker does not have direct access to the database but can monitor the queries sent by a user when they sync their contacts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Alice installs the messaging app and syncs her encrypted phone contacts.
    <ul>
      <li>The system queries specific database entries matching some of her contactsâ€™ encrypted phone numbers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An observer (e.g., the service provider monitoring the network or a government agency) watches Aliceâ€™s access patterns.
    <ul>
      <li>They see that Aliceâ€™s device queries entries #5, #12, #28, and #34.</li>
      <li>These correspond to specific phone numbers already registered in the app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Consequences of the Leakage</strong></p>

<p>ðŸ”´ Encryption is not doing anything! The entire social graph is being reconstructed even with encrypted database.</p>

<h3 id="kidney-transplantation-records">Kidney Transplantation Records</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario: A Hospital Managing Kidney Transplants</strong>
A hospital maintains a highly sensitive database of available kidneys for transplantation. Each kidney entry is linked to metadata such as blood type compatibility, donor status, and urgency levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database Structure: Each entry (e.g., #3, #7, #10) corresponds to a kidney available for transplant.</li>
  <li>Patient Matching Process: When a new patient arrives needing a transplant, doctors query the database to find a compatible kidney.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Leakage Due to Unprotected Access Patterns</strong>
An insurance company or an external observer does not have access to the decrypted medical records but can see database queries in real-time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A new patient is admitted with a suspected kidney issue.</li>
  <li>The hospital system queries specific database entries (e.g., #3, #7, #10), which correspond to kidney availability.</li>
  <li>The insurance company observes these access patterns and correlates them with the patientâ€™s recent admission and prescribed medication (e.g., immunosuppressants for transplant patients).</li>
  <li>Future Accesses Leak More Information:
    <ul>
      <li>Later, the same kidney entries (#3, #7, #10) are accessed again â†’ Suggesting that a patient is progressing toward transplant surgery.</li>
      <li>If a new entry is accessed instead â†’ Suggests a different patient is now in need of a transplant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Consequences of the Leakage</strong></p>

<p>ðŸ”´ Insurance Denial:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The insurance company infers that the patient has end-stage kidney disease and may soon require a costly transplant.</li>
  <li>They increase premiums or deny coverage before the patient even formally applies.</li>
</ul>

<p>ðŸ”´ Privacy Violation &amp; Targeted Ads:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The patient starts receiving targeted ads for dialysis centers and transplant medications, even though their medical records are encrypted.</li>
  <li>Their employer, which provides group insurance, may notice these ads and suspect a major health issue, impacting future employment.</li>
</ul>

<p>ðŸ”´ Black Market Risks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an external attacker observes that a specific kidney is being accessed repeatedly, they might infer a specific high-priority transplant case is ongoing.</li>
  <li>This could lead to kidney brokers or criminals targeting the patient or hospital staff.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="oblivious-ram">Oblivious RAM</h2>
<p>Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is the most fundamental Oblivious Algorithm â€“ a cryptographic protocol designed to conceal access patterns during data interactions in the simplest abstraction of an array. When clients are accessing an array stored in cloud services, even when data is encrypted, the sequence of operationsâ€”such as which entries are accessed and in what orderâ€”can inadvertently expose private details.</p>

<p>ORAM works by introducing randomized access and periodic reshuffling of data, making access patterns indistinguishable from random behavior.</p>

<h3 id="linear-scan---naive-design-for-oram">Linear Scan - Naive Design for ORAM</h3>

<p>The easiest way for designing an ORAM is to do a linear scan of the entire RAM with every read/write access. This is easy to implement, but the operation cost would boost from $O(1)$ to $O(N)$ where $N$ is the size of the RAM.</p>

<h3 id="path-oram---a-practical-solution">Path ORAM - A Practical Solution</h3>
<p>In 2012, Stefanov and Shi introduced <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/280.pdf">PathORAM</a>, an efficient and simple ORAM scheme that made ORAM practical.</p>

<h4 id="core-idea">Core Idea</h4>
<p>PathORAM organizes data into a <strong>binary tree structure</strong> stored on an untrusted server. The client maintains <strong>a small local stash</strong> to temporarily store blocks during access operations. The key concept is that each data block is assigned <strong>a random leaf node</strong> and is always stored along the path from the root to that leaf.
<em>TODO: add imgs</em></p>

<h4 id="operations">Operations</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Read/Write</strong>:
    <ol>
      <li>The client downloades the <strong>entire path</strong> from the root to the leaf associated with the requested block.</li>
      <li>The client assigns a new random leaf to the block, and the block is modified (if the operation is write).</li>
      <li>All blocks downloaded are temporarily stored in the stash, along with other blocks on the path.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Eviction</strong>:
    <ol>
      <li>The client writes back blocks from the stash to the tree, ensuring that blocks always remain within the correct path.</li>
      <li>Write to the same path as the client downloades the requested block, write in the order from leaf to root</li>
      <li>For each node, put as many blocks as possible. (Blocks are pushed down the tree as much as possible to maintain efficient storage distribution.)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="security--efficiency">Security &amp; Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Security: Every access pattern looks identical (always fetches a full path), ensuring obliviousness.</li>
  <li>Bandwidth Overhead: O(log N) per operation, significantly better than earlier schemes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="follow-up-works">Follow-up Works</h2>
<p>Since PathORAM, there has been extensive follow-up research on designing ORAM schemes with improved performance under various metrics.</p>

<p>Additionally, numerous papers, libraries, and implementations exist for other oblivious algorithms, such as oblivious maps and oblivious sorting, many of which leverage ORAM techniques as a foundation.</p>

<p><em>TODO: is this the right statement? if so, add citations</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As cloud computing becomes the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, ensuring data confidentiality goes beyond simple encryption. The examples of private contact discovery and kidney transplantation records demonstrate that access patterns can reveal highly sensitive informationâ€”even when the underlying data remains encrypted. This underscores the necessity of Oblivious Algorithms in protecting user privacy.</p>

<p>While Path ORAM represents a practical advancement in ORAM design, the field continues to evolve, with researchers striving to improve efficiency, reduce bandwidth overhead, and extend oblivious techniques to broader applications such as secure computation and machine learning. As more organizations recognize the risks of access pattern leakage, integrating Oblivious Algorithms into cloud-based services will be essential for building truly private and secure systems.</p>
