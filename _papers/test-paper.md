## üîê What is Oblivious RAM (ORAM)?
Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic technique that conceals access patterns to data stored on untrusted servers. It ensures that the sequence of read and write operations remains indistinguishable to observers, even if the data is encrypted. This protection is vital in scenarios like cloud storage, secure processors, and privacy-preserving computations, where access patterns could leak sensitive information.
